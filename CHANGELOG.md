# Changelog

All notable public changes will be recorded here.

## Unreleased

- Prepared the repository for public preview publication.
- Added public repository hygiene files, security policy, contribution guide,
  issue templates and release notes.
- Kept local planning history out of the public source baseline.

### Added

- Typed profile model in `multidb::config_spec`: `ProfileKnobs`, the
  `KNOB_REGISTRY` const table (bounds, timing, runtime sink and enforcement of
  every knob), `RESERVED_KNOBS`, built-in variants pinned 1:1 to storage
  profiles (`profile_variants`), and the pure resolver `resolve_profile` /
  `resolve_named_profile`, which records the provenance of every knob and a
  `prof_` digest. Presets equal today's runtime defaults: compression none,
  limits unlimited (planned until the single write pipeline lands) and query
  concurrency auto. See `docs/profiles.md`.
- `PerformanceConfig::with_profile_knobs`, `ResolvedProfile::performance_config`,
  `parse_knob_assignment` (`path=value` with did-you-mean suggestions) and
  `built_in_profile_normalized` (trims, lowercases and maps `-` to `_`;
  `built_in_profile` stays an exact match).
- `DatabaseSpec.custom_profile`, a spec version 2 field. A version 1 document
  that sets it fails validation with `FIELD_REQUIRES_SPEC_V2`; documents
  without it serialize, validate and plan exactly as before, pinned by the
  frozen corpus in `tests/fixtures/spec-v1/`.
- `CollectionRole` derives `PartialOrd` and `Ord`.
- `DatabaseSpec` version 2 (`DATABASE_SPEC_VERSION_V2`,
  `SUPPORTED_SPEC_VERSIONS = 1..=2`): a version 1 spec plus `custom_profile`
  (`extends` a built-in product slug or alias, typed `knobs`, raise-only
  `floors` and `compatible_roles` add/remove). Validation, `PolicyCompiler`
  and `ConfigExplainer` resolve the profile: `CompiledPolicy.resolved_profile`
  carries the resolved knobs, explain reports one `$.profile.knobs.<path>`
  decision per knob (value, source, what applies it and when) plus
  `$.profile.storage_profile` and `$.profile.not_configurable.*`, and
  `config plan` reports `custom_profile` changes as unsupported
  `change_profile` steps. New issue codes include `PROFILE_UNKNOWN`,
  `PROFILE_NOT_PROVISIONABLE`, `GUARANTEE_BELOW_PROFILE_FLOOR`,
  `OVERRIDE_IS_METADATA_ONLY` and `OVERRIDE_SHADOWS_TYPED_KNOB`; see
  `docs/profiles.md`.
- `multidb::config_spec::spec_io`: bounded spec reading (`read_spec_file`,
  `decode_spec_bytes`, `decode_spec_value`) with a 1 MiB limit, a version peek
  before the typed decode and node and scalar-byte budgets for YAML alias
  expansion. The CLI and the Control Plane read every spec through it.
- `database_spec_v2_schema()` and the checked-in
  `docs/schemas/database-spec-v2.schema.json`; knob bounds and enums are
  generated from `KNOB_REGISTRY`. The version 1 schema is unchanged.
- `examples/custom-profile/multidb.yaml`, a version 2 validation and explain
  example covered by `scripts/templates-smoke.ps1`.

### Changed

- Explain wording: `$.compiled_policy.storage_profile` names the storage class
  and engine instead of "storage profile selected", encryption at rest reads
  "requested; enforced only on the Rust API with an encryption config in this
  build" instead of "encrypted storage required", and `RuntimeLimits` is
  labelled advisory catalog guidance that this build does not enforce (its
  values are unchanged).
- Version 1 specs gain Advice only: `PROFILE_NOT_PROVISIONABLE` after
  `CUSTOM_PROFILE` for unknown profiles, and `OVERRIDE_IS_METADATA_ONLY` for
  `overrides` keys in a knob namespace (including Studio's `profile.custom.*`
  keys). Their existing issues, order, status and plan ids are unchanged.
- A missing, non-integer or unsupported spec `version` is a validation issue
  (`MISSING_VERSION`, `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`): the CLI exits 2 and the Control
  Plane answers 422 (`/config/validate` with the report, `/config/plan` with
  error code `invalid_spec_version`). A body without `version` was HTTP 400
  `invalid_json` and CLI exit 1 before.
- Specs over 1 MiB (`SPEC_TOO_LARGE`) or over the YAML alias expansion budget
  (`SPEC_TOO_COMPLEX`) are rejected before the typed decode.

### Breaking

- `DatabaseSpec` struct literals must set the new `custom_profile` field;
  `None` keeps today's behaviour.
- `ConfigSpecError::UnsupportedVersion` gains a `supported` range field.
- `CompiledPolicy` struct literals must set the new `resolved_profile` field.

## 0.1.0-preview.1

- Initial public-preview target.
- Includes the public-preview support surface documented in
  `docs/support-matrix.md`.
