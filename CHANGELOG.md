# Changelog

All notable public changes will be recorded here.

## Unreleased

- Hardened Control Plane `admin` login: failed password checks now lock out
  only the client IP (IPv6 /64) that made them, under a server-wide soft
  ceiling of 20x `MULTIDB_ADMIN_LOGIN_MAX_FAILURES` per window. Other usernames
  no longer lock out `admin`. At most 2 Argon2 password checks run at once, and
  extra login or change-password requests get `503 auth_busy` with
  `Retry-After: 1`. Usernames over 256 bytes and passwords over 1024 bytes are
  rejected with `400`. A `MULTIDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` longer than 1024 bytes stops
  startup when it would be stored (no stored credential, or a reset). Rate-limited refusals
  and failures for unknown usernames are coalesced in the audit log.
- Prepared the repository for public preview publication.
- Added public repository hygiene files, security policy, contribution guide,
  issue templates and release notes.
- Kept local planning history out of the public source baseline.
- Fixed `multidb serve` / `multidb admin serve` starting with an empty RBAC
  policy after a restart, and admin bootstrap/login overwriting stored roles,
  PG-user mappings and the audit flag; plain database openers now reload
  persisted security state and fail closed if it is corrupt.
- Time-series retention now computes its cutoff from server time instead of
  the incoming point's timestamp, so one future-dated or microsecond-scaled
  point can no longer delete a whole series. Points more than
  `max_future_skew_millis` ahead of server time (default 300000 ms for new
  collections, settable when the collection is created; collections created
  before this change keep accepting future timestamps) and points older than
  `now - retention_millis` are rejected. New collections require a positive
  `retention_millis` that is at least `chunk_millis`; existing collections with
  a non-positive retention stay readable but refuse writes. Time-series
  validation errors from the Control Plane now return HTTP 400
  `invalid_value` instead of 500, and `time_bucket` and range queries no longer
  overflow near the `i64` bounds.
- Changefeed paging and `AS OF TIMESTAMP` resolution now read bounded
  commit-log windows: catch-up is linear and memory is bounded by the page size
  instead of the whole log. The earliest-LSN lookup reads the recorded floor or
  LSN 1 directly; only a legacy log that has neither falls back to a full scan.
- Added manual history GC: `Database::gc_history` and
  `multidb maintenance gc --db <path> --profile <profile> [--dry-run]
  [--batch-size <n>] [--max-batches <n>] [--history-retain-lsns <n>]
  [--commit-log-retain-lsns <n>]`, with `multidb_history_gc_*` metrics. It
  prunes MVCC versions below `min(current LSN, AS OF pins, temporal min_lsn,
  current LSN - history-retain-lsns + 1)` in batches bounded by writes, record
  bytes and commit-log window reads, and truncates the commit log only with an
  explicit retention, never below durable consumer positions. It is local
  single-node only, needs exclusive file access, and does not shrink the redb
  file. `multidb serve` does not run history GC online or in the background
  yet. Without `--history-retain-lsns` (`mvcc_retain_lsns`), GC removes `AS OF`
  history below the GC watermark (the current LSN unless a temporal
  `keep_history` retention or an `AS OF` pin is older) for every table without a
  temporal `keep_history` retention, and the report carries a `note` saying so. On encrypted databases each pruned
  MVCC version or commit-log record keeps its small key-version row in
  `__enc_versions`, so GC reclaims value bytes but not those rows.
- Commit-log truncation (`--commit-log-retain-lsns`) breaks the incremental
  backup chain: take a new full backup afterwards. Run it while no writers are
  active (the CLI is offline anyway); after-commit hook delivery that meets
  truncated or missing commit records now fails closed instead of skipping
  them. Materialized views, full-text indexes and geo indexes created after
  truncation start from the current rows and LSN instead of replaying LSN 0.
- `AS OF` reads below the GC history horizon fail with `RetentionExpired`, as
  do system-versioned history scans and `enable_system_versioning` whose
  `min_lsn` is below the horizon; changefeed tokens below a truncated commit
  log fail with `TokenExpired`; incremental backups whose parent predates the
  truncated log fail with `BackupError::CommitLogTruncated`. Older binaries
  ignore the horizon, so do not downgrade a GC'd database file.
- Repeated `ack_subscription` calls with the token that is already stored no
  longer write a commit. A subscription worker's own ack still commits, so an
  idle worker keeps adding one commit per poll interval.
