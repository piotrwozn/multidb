# Changelog

All notable public changes will be recorded here.

## Unreleased

- Prepared the repository for public preview publication.
- Added public repository hygiene files, security policy, contribution guide,
  issue templates and release notes.
- Kept local planning history out of the public source baseline.

### Added

- Typed profile model in `multidb::config_spec`: `ProfileKnobs`, the
  `KNOB_REGISTRY` const table (bounds, timing, runtime sink and enforcement of
  every knob), `RESERVED_KNOBS`, built-in variants pinned 1:1 to storage
  profiles (`profile_variants`), and the pure resolver `resolve_profile` /
  `resolve_named_profile`, which records the provenance of every knob and a
  `prof_` digest. Presets equal today's runtime defaults: compression none,
  limits unlimited (planned until the single write pipeline lands) and query
  concurrency auto. See `docs/profiles.md`.
- `PerformanceConfig::with_profile_knobs`, `ResolvedProfile::performance_config`,
  `parse_knob_assignment` (`path=value` with did-you-mean suggestions) and
  `built_in_profile_normalized` (trims, lowercases and maps `-` to `_`;
  `built_in_profile` stays an exact match).
- `DatabaseSpec.custom_profile`, a spec version 2 field. A version 1 document
  that sets it fails validation with `FIELD_REQUIRES_SPEC_V2`; documents
  without it serialize, validate and plan exactly as before, pinned by the
  frozen corpus in `tests/fixtures/spec-v1/`.
- `CollectionRole` derives `PartialOrd` and `Ord`.
- `DatabaseSpec` version 2 (`DATABASE_SPEC_VERSION_V2`,
  `SUPPORTED_SPEC_VERSIONS = 1..=2`): a version 1 spec plus `custom_profile`
  (`extends` a built-in product slug or alias, typed `knobs`, raise-only
  `floors` and `compatible_roles` add/remove). Validation, `PolicyCompiler`
  and `ConfigExplainer` resolve the profile: `CompiledPolicy.resolved_profile`
  carries the resolved knobs, explain reports one `$.profile.knobs.<path>`
  decision per knob (value, source, what applies it and when) plus
  `$.profile.storage_profile` and `$.profile.not_configurable.*`, and
  `config plan` reports `custom_profile` changes as unsupported
  `change_profile` steps. New issue codes include `PROFILE_UNKNOWN`,
  `PROFILE_NOT_PROVISIONABLE`, `GUARANTEE_BELOW_PROFILE_FLOOR`,
  `OVERRIDE_IS_METADATA_ONLY` and `OVERRIDE_SHADOWS_TYPED_KNOB`; see
  `docs/profiles.md`.
- `multidb::config_spec::spec_io`: bounded spec reading (`read_spec_file`,
  `decode_spec_bytes`, `decode_spec_value`) with a 1 MiB limit, a version peek
  before the typed decode and node and scalar-byte budgets for YAML alias
  expansion. The CLI and the Control Plane read every spec through it.
- `database_spec_v2_schema()` and the checked-in
  `docs/schemas/database-spec-v2.schema.json`; knob bounds and enums are
  generated from `KNOB_REGISTRY`. The version 1 schema is unchanged.
- `examples/custom-profile/multidb.yaml`, a version 2 validation and explain
  example covered by `scripts/templates-smoke.ps1`.
- Persisted profiles in `multidb::db`: `ResolvedProfile::bind` and
  `CompiledPolicy::binding` produce a `RuntimeProfileBinding`, and
  `create_database_with_profile` creates a new single-node database that
  stores the resolved knobs in `__meta.profile_manifest`
  (`PersistedProfileManifest`, `StorageFormat`). Every single-node opener,
  and therefore `multidb serve`, re-validates the manifest and re-applies its
  knobs at every open. Compression turns on value framing and
  `schema_version` 2, which older binaries refuse. CP, AP and sharded openers
  refuse manifests. `inspect_database_metadata` (`MetadataProbe`,
  `ProbedMetadata`) reads a database's metadata without creating files. See
  `docs/profiles.md`.
- `AnyEngine::is_value_framed` and `AnyEngine::with_value_framing`, which
  wraps an open engine in compression framing without reopening it.
- CLI profile commands: `multidb profile show <profile> [--override
  path=value]...` (resolved knobs with source, timing, enforcement and sink,
  plus what-if overrides with did-you-mean suggestions), `profile show --db
  <path>` (the persisted profile manifest, or "legacy database"), `profile
  explain --spec <file>` (exit 2 when the profile is invalid) and `profile
  knobs` (the knob registry and reserved knobs). `profile list --json` adds
  `variants` and the canonical variant's `knobs`; the text output adds
  `variants=`.
- `multidb config upgrade --spec <in> [--out <file>] [--force] [--json]`
  converts a spec to version 2 and turns Studio's `profile.custom.*` keys into
  `custom_profile`; it is idempotent and refuses to overwrite files without
  `--force`.
- `multidb init --guided --profile <p> --override path=value...
  [--profile-name <slug>]` writes a version 2 spec with a `custom_profile`
  that extends `<p>`. Without `--override` guided init is unchanged.
- `config_spec::suggest_profile_name`, the did-you-mean lookup over built-in
  profile slugs and aliases.

### Changed

- Explain wording: `$.compiled_policy.storage_profile` names the storage class
  and engine instead of "storage profile selected", encryption at rest reads
  "requested; enforced only on the Rust API with an encryption config in this
  build" instead of "encrypted storage required", and `RuntimeLimits` is
  labelled advisory catalog guidance that this build does not enforce (its
  values are unchanged).
- Version 1 specs gain Advice only: `PROFILE_NOT_PROVISIONABLE` after
  `CUSTOM_PROFILE` for unknown profiles, and `OVERRIDE_IS_METADATA_ONLY` for
  `overrides` keys in a knob namespace (including Studio's `profile.custom.*`
  keys). Their existing issues, order, status and plan ids are unchanged.
- A missing, non-integer or unsupported spec `version` is a validation issue
  (`MISSING_VERSION`, `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`): the CLI exits 2 and the Control
  Plane answers 422 (`/config/validate` with the report, `/config/plan` with
  error code `invalid_spec_version`). A body without `version` was HTTP 400
  `invalid_json` and CLI exit 1 before.
- Specs over 1 MiB (`SPEC_TOO_LARGE`) or over the YAML alias expansion budget
  (`SPEC_TOO_COMPLEX`) are rejected before the typed decode.
- Metadata reads tolerate compression frames. A legacy database created with
  `OperationalConfig.performance.compression` and opened without it now fails
  with `StorageFormatMismatch` (previously an opaque serde error), and
  encrypted metadata opened without a key fails with `MetadataUnreadable`
  ("supply OperationalConfig.encryption"). `SchemaVersionMismatch` now reports
  `expected: 2`, the newest version this build reads.
- Restore builds its target from the profile manifest in the backup: a
  restored compressed manifest database is value-framed again, as its
  manifest says, and `verify_backup` covers such backups. A restore
  `DbConfig` whose storage profile disagrees with the backed-up manifest
  fails with `BackupError::Config(ProfileMismatch)`, and a corrupt backed-up
  manifest with `BackupError::Corruption`, before the target is created.
  Restore now reads the full backup payload before it creates the target, so
  a full payload that fails its checksum or decryption no longer leaves an
  empty initialized target behind.
- Every CLI `--profile` flag and `MULTIDB_PROFILE` also accept product slugs
  (their canonical variant), aliases in snake or kebab case, and `auto`,
  which reads the storage profile and replication of the existing database
  (`restore` refuses `auto`). Every value accepted before keeps its meaning.
  Guided init accepts profile names in any case.
- Guided init with an alias of a non-canonical variant (for example
  `high_durability` or `time-series`) prints a warning that the version 1
  spec records the product slug; `--json` adds `warnings`, `variant` and
  `storage_profile` to the summary object.

### Breaking

- `DatabaseSpec` struct literals must set the new `custom_profile` field;
  `None` keeps today's behaviour.
- `ConfigSpecError::UnsupportedVersion` gains a `supported` range field.
- `CompiledPolicy` struct literals must set the new `resolved_profile` field.
- `ConfigError` gains `AlreadyInitialized`, `StorageFormatMismatch`,
  `UnsupportedProfileManifest`, `ProfileManifestInvalid` and
  `MetadataUnreadable`. `ConfigError` is not `non_exhaustive`, so exhaustive
  matches outside the crate must handle them.

## 0.1.0-preview.1

- Initial public-preview target.
